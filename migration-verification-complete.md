### 🧪 **Quick Test Commands**

```bash
# SSH to Pi
ssh pi@192.168.1.11

# Check service status
curl http://192.168.1.11:3000/health
curl http://192.168.1.11:3001/health  
curl http://192.168.1.11:3002/health

# Test hardware
cd /home/pi/eform-locker
node scripts/testing/test-basic-relay-control.js

# Check logs
tail -f logs/*.log
```

### 📋 **Next Steps**
