## Task 15.3 Implementation Summary

This validation confirms that the system meets all performance and health requirements:

1. **Performance Requirements Met:**
   - Panel operations with 500 lockers complete under 1 second
   - Status updates for 3 kiosks complete under 1 second
   - Concurrent access handled efficiently
   - Memory usage remains within acceptable limits

2. **Power Interruption Handling:**
   - System restart events properly logged
   - Command queues cleared on restart
   - No automatic locker opening after power restoration
   - Database integrity maintained through WAL mode

3. **End-of-Day Operations:**
   - CSV schema with fixed columns implemented
   - VIP lockers excluded by default
   - Bulk operations handle large datasets efficiently
   - Data consistency maintained during operations

4. **Operational Documentation:**
   - Complete runbook with emergency procedures
   - Failure classification system implemented
   - Spare parts inventory documented
   - Maintenance schedules defined

## Next Steps

Task 15.3 is now complete. The system has been validated for:
- Performance under load
- Recovery from power interruptions
- End-of-day operational procedures
- Comprehensive operational documentation

All sub-tasks have been implemented and validated successfully.
