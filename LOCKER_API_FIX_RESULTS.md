# Locker API Response Format Fix Results

## Issue Summary
The locker API was returning `{"lockers":{}}` (empty object) instead of `{"lockers":[]}` (empty array) when no lockers were found or when using certain kiosk IDs.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `LockerStateManager.getAllLockers()` method when using the `dbManager` code path. The code was incorrectly using synchronous `better-sqlite3` style API calls on an asynchronous `sqlite3` database connection:

```typescript
// BROKEN CODE (returned Statement object instead of results)
if (this.dbManager) {
  const db = this.dbManager.getConnection().getDatabase();
  return db.prepare(query).all(...params); // Returns Statement{}, not results
}
```

## Fix Applied
Updated all `dbManager` code paths in `LockerStateManager` to use the correct asynchronous API:

```typescript
// FIXED CODE (returns actual query results)
if (this.dbManager) {
  const connection = this.dbManager.getConnection();
  return await connection.all(query, params) as Locker[];
}
```

## Methods Fixed
1. `getAllLockers()` - Main method causing the API response issue
2. `getLocker()` - Individual locker retrieval
3. `releaseLocker()` - Locker release operations
4. `blockLocker()` - Locker blocking operations
5. `unblockLocker()` - Locker unblocking operations
6. `logEvent()` - Event logging

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```
ðŸ“Š LockerStateManager result: Statement {}
ðŸ“Š LockerStateManager result type: object
ðŸ“Š LockerStateManager is array: false
```

### After Fix
```
ðŸ“Š LockerStateManager result: []
ðŸ“Š LockerStateManager result type: object
ðŸ“Š LockerStateManager is array: true
ðŸ“Š LockerStateManager length: 0
```

### API Response Format (Fixed)
```json
{
  "lockers": [
    {
      "kiosk_id": "kiosk-1",
      "id": 1,
      "status": "Free",
      "owner_type": null,
      "owner_key": null,
      "reserved_at": null,
      "owned_at": null,
      "version": 1,
      "is_vip": 0,
      "created_at": "2025-08-25 14:08:58",
      "updated_at": "2025-08-25 14:08:58"
    }
    // ... more lockers
  ],
  "total": 30
}
```

## Database Findings
- The database contains 30 lockers for `kiosk_id: "kiosk-1"`
- No lockers exist for `kiosk_id: "K1"` (which was being used in tests)
- All lockers are currently in "Free" status

## Impact
This fix resolves the critical API response format issue that was causing:
- Client-side JavaScript errors when trying to iterate over lockers
- Incorrect locker count displays
- Broken locker management functionality

## Files Modified
- `shared/services/locker-state-manager.ts` - Fixed all database API calls
- Rebuilt shared module with `npm run build:shared`

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - API now correctly returns array format for lockers
