# Kiosk UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Master PIN Screen Stuck Issue
**Problem**: The master PIN screen was always visible and couldn't be dismissed because all screens were visible simultaneously.

**Root Cause**: CSS only defined `.screen.active` but didn't hide screens that are NOT active.

**Fix**: Updated CSS screen management rules:
```css
/* Before */
.screen {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    z-index: 2;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

.screen.active {
    opacity: 1;
}

/* After */
.screen {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    z-index: 2;
    display: none; /* Hide all screens by default */
    flex-direction: column;
}

.screen.active {
    display: flex; /* Show only active screen */
    opacity: 1;
}
```

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Errors
**Problem**: Performance tracker was trying to make cross-origin requests from port 3002 to port 3001, violating CSP.

**Error**: `Fetch API cannot load http://192.168.1.8:3001/api/performance/ui-event. Refused to connect because it violates the document's Content Security Policy.`

**Fix**: 
1. **Modified performance tracker** to use same origin instead of cross-origin requests
2. **Added proxy endpoint** in kiosk service to forward performance events to panel service
3. **Reduced console logging** to avoid spam

### 3. Console Log Spam
**Problem**: Excessive logging was cluttering the browser console.

**Fixes**:
- Reduced background grid update logging (only log when grid size changes)
- Reduced performance tracker batch reporting logs
- Added lastGridSize tracking to minimize repeated logs

## Files Modified

1. **app/kiosk/src/ui/static/styles.css**
   - Fixed screen visibility management

2. **app/kiosk/src/ui/static/performance-tracker.js**
   - Changed to use same origin for requests
   - Reduced console logging

3. **app/kiosk/src/ui/static/app.js**
   - Added lastGridSize tracking
   - Reduced background grid update logging

4. **app/kiosk/src/index.ts**
   - Added performance proxy endpoint `/api/performance/ui-event`

## Testing Required

After deploying these changes to the Raspberry Pi:

1. **Test screen switching**: 
   - Click Master button → should show PIN screen
   - Click back button → should return to main screen
   - Only one screen should be visible at a time

2. **Test console errors**:
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Should see no CSP errors
   - Reduced console log spam

3. **Test performance tracking**:
   - Performance events should still be tracked
   - No cross-origin errors

## Deployment Instructions

1. The kiosk service has been built with `npm run build:kiosk`
2. Push changes to git: `git add . && git commit -m "Fix kiosk UI screen management and CSP issues" && git push origin main`
3. On Raspberry Pi: `git pull origin main`
4. Restart kiosk service: `sudo pkill -f "node.*kiosk" && npm run start:kiosk &`
5. Test the UI at `http://192.168.1.8:3002`

## Expected Results

- ✅ Master PIN screen no longer stuck on display
- ✅ Clean screen transitions between main/PIN/locker screens
- ✅ No CSP errors in browser console
- ✅ Reduced console log spam
- ✅ Performance tracking still functional
