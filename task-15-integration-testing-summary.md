- Display name synchronization
- Performance under load
- Error recovery and resilience

**Key Test Cases**:
- Broadcast performance validation (< 2 seconds)

### 3. Turkish Language Validation Tests
**File**: `tests/integration/turkish-language-validation.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- Turkish character support (Ã§, ÄŸ, Ä±, Ã¶, ÅŸ, Ã¼, etc.)
- Error message localization
- State name consistency (BoÅŸ, Dolu, AÃ§Ä±lÄ±yor, Hata, Engelli)
- Character encoding and display
- Input validation and sanitization
- Fallback behavior for missing translations

**Key Test Cases**:
- Turkish character validation in locker names
- Preset name generation with Turkish examples
- Error message translation accuracy
- Character encoding in JSON serialization
- Database operations with Turkish text
- Input sanitization for security

### 4. Accessibility Requirements Tests
**File**: `tests/integration/accessibility-requirements.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- Touch target requirements (56px minimum)
- 2-meter readability validation
- Color-blind safety requirements
- High contrast text validation
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA attributes and accessibility features
- Turkish language accessibility

**Key Test Cases**:
- Tile size validation (120x120px with 56px touch targets)
- Font size requirements for 2m viewing distance
- Color contrast ratio validation
- Icon usage alongside colors for color-blind users
- Responsive grid layout validation
- Animation performance optimization
- Turkish character rendering and language attributes
