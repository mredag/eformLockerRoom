# Dual Relay Card Problem & Solution - Complete Case Study

## üìã Problem Statement

### Initial Issue
When connecting 2 Waveshare Modbus RTU Relay 16CH cards to a single USB-RS485 adapter, **both relay cards were responding to the same commands**. This meant that triggering relay 1 would activate relay 1 on both cards simultaneously, making it impossible to control them independently.

### System Context
- **Hardware**: 2x Waveshare Modbus RTU Relay 16CH cards
- **Connection**: Single USB-RS485 adapter (CH340 serial converter)
- **Target**: 32 independent lockers (16 per card)
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi 4 running eForm Locker System
- **Protocol**: Modbus RTU over RS485

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Hypothesis (INCORRECT)
Initially, we suspected the issue was related to **DIP switch configuration** for setting slave addresses, as this is common with many Modbus devices.

### Discovery Process
1. **Documentation Research**: Found Waveshare documentation mentioning DIP switches
2. **Hardware Inspection**: Looked for physical DIP switches on the cards
3. **Further Research**: User provided additional Waveshare documentation
4. **Key Discovery**: Waveshare Modbus RTU Relay 16CH does **NOT use DIP switches**

### Actual Root Cause
**Both relay cards had the same default slave address (1)**, causing them to respond to identical commands. The Waveshare Modbus RTU Relay 16CH uses **software-based slave address configuration** stored in register `0x4000`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Implementation

### Step 1: Understanding the Waveshare Configuration Method

According to official Waveshare documentation:
- **Default slave address**: 1 (factory setting)
- **Address storage**: Register `0x4000` in each device
- **Configuration method**: Write Single Register (Function `0x06`)
- **Address range**: 1-255 (0 is reserved for broadcast)

### Step 2: Software Configuration Tool Development

Created a comprehensive configuration script (`scripts/configure-relay-slave-addresses.js`) with the following features:

#### Key Functions:
```javascript
// CRC16 calculation for Modbus RTU
calculateCRC16(data) {
  let crc = 0xFFFF;
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    crc ^= data[i];
    for (let j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
      if (crc & 0x0001) {
        crc = (crc >> 1) ^ 0xA001;
      } else {
        crc = crc >> 1;
      }
    }
  }
  return crc;
}

// Build Write Single Register command (Function 0x06)
buildWriteRegisterCommand(slaveId, register, value) {
  const buffer = Buffer.alloc(8);
  buffer[0] = slaveId;                    // Slave ID (0x00 for broadcast)
  buffer[1] = 0x06;                       // Function: Write Single Register
  buffer[2] = (register >> 8) & 0xFF;    // Register high byte
  buffer[3] = register & 0xFF;            // Register low byte
  buffer[4] = (value >> 8) & 0xFF;        // Value high byte
  buffer[5] = value & 0xFF;               // Value low byte
  
  const crc = this.calculateCRC16(buffer.subarray(0, 6));
  buffer[6] = crc & 0xFF;                 // CRC low byte
  buffer[7] = (crc >> 8) & 0xFF;          // CRC high byte
  
  return buffer;
}
```

### Step 3: Configuration Commands

#### Manual Configuration Commands:
```bash
# Set Card to Slave Address 1:
Command: 00 06 40 00 00 01 5C 1B
- 00: Broadcast address (all devices respond)
- 06: Write Single Register function
- 40 00: Register 0x4000 (slave address storage)
- 00 01: New slave address (1)
- 5C 1B: CRC16 checksum

# Set Card to Slave Address 2:
Command: 00 06 40 00 00 02 1C 1A
- 00: Broadcast address
- 06: Write Single Register function  
- 40 00: Register 0x4000
- 00 02: New slave address (2)
- 1C 1A: CRC16 checksum
```

### Step 4: System Configuration Updates

Updated the system configuration (`config/system.json`) to support dual cards:

```json
{
  "hardware": {
    "relay_cards": [
      {
        "slave_address": 1,
        "channels": 16,
        "type": "waveshare_16ch",
        "description": "Locker Bank 1-16 (Card 1)",
        "enabled": true
      },
      {
        "slave_address": 2,
        "channels": 16,
        "type": "waveshare_16ch", 
        "description": "Locker Bank 17-32 (Card 2)",
        "enabled": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "lockers": {
    "total_count": 32,
    "layout": {
      "rows": 8,
      "columns": 4,
      "numbering_scheme": "sequential"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Automatic Locker-to-Card Mapping

The existing software already had the correct mapping logic:

```javascript
// Convert locker ID to hardware addresses
const cardId = Math.ceil(lockerNumber / 16); // Card 1, 2, 3...
const relayId = ((lockerNumber - 1) % 16) + 1; // Relay 1-16 on card
const coilAddress = relayId - 1; // 0-based coil address

// Examples:
// Locker 1  -> Card 1, Relay 1,  Coil 0
// Locker 5  -> Card 1, Relay 5,  Coil 4
// Locker 16 -> Card 1, Relay 16, Coil 15
// Locker 17 -> Card 2, Relay 1,  Coil 0
// Locker 32 -> Card 2, Relay 16, Coil 15
```

## üß™ Testing & Verification Process

### Phase 1: Initial Problem Identification
```bash
# Test showed both cards responding to same commands
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.8:3002/api/locker/open \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"locker_id": 5, "staff_user": "test", "reason": "testing"}'
# Result: Both cards activated relay 5
```

### Phase 2: Hardware Communication Testing
```javascript
// Direct Modbus communication test
const testResults = {
  "Address 1": "‚úÖ Responding - Current address: 1",
  "Address 2": "‚è∞ Timeout - Not configured yet"
};
```

### Phase 3: Broadcast Configuration
```javascript
// Used broadcast address to configure one card
const broadcastCommand = "00 06 40 00 00 02 1C 1A"; // Set to address 2
// Result: One card now responds to address 2
```

### Phase 4: Dual Card Verification
```javascript
const finalTest = {
  "Card 1 (Address 1)": {
    "Read Address": "‚úÖ Response: 01 03 02 00 01 [CRC] (address = 1)",
    "Relay Test": "‚úÖ Response: 01 05 00 00 FF 00 [CRC]"
  },
  "Card 2 (Address 2)": {
    "Read Address": "‚úÖ Response: 02 03 02 00 02 [CRC] (address = 2)", 
    "Relay Test": "‚úÖ Response: 02 05 00 00 FF 00 [CRC]"
  }
};
```

### Phase 5: Full System Integration Test
```javascript
const systemTest = {
  "Card 1 Tests": [
    "Locker 1: ‚úÖ Status 200 - Locker 1 opened successfully",
    "Locker 5: ‚úÖ Status 200 - Locker 5 opened successfully", 
    "Locker 16: ‚úÖ Status 200 - Locker 16 opened successfully"
  ],
  "Card 2 Tests": [
    "Locker 17: ‚úÖ Status 200 - Locker 17 opened successfully",
    "Locker 20: ‚úÖ Status 200 - Locker 20 opened successfully",
    "Locker 32: ‚úÖ Status 200 - Locker 32 opened successfully"
  ]
};
```
