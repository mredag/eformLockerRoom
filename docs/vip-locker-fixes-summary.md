# VIP Locker Handling Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to properly handle VIP lockers across the eForm Locker System, ensuring VIP lockers maintain their ownership status and are properly excluded from bulk operations when required.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Panel Bulk Open Endpoint (`app/panel/src/routes/locker-routes.ts`)

**Problem**: The bulk open endpoint was releasing VIP lockers and ignoring the `excludeVip` flag.

**Solution**:
- Added `excludeVip` parameter to bulk open schema (defaults to `true`)
- Fetch each locker via `LockerStateManager.getLocker` before processing
- Skip VIP lockers when `excludeVip` is true, recording them in failure list with reason `vip`
- Honor `excludeVip` input for both `/bulk/open` and `/end-of-day` operations
- Added VIP status logging in event details

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Fetch locker to check VIP status
const locker = await lockerStateManager.getLocker(kioskId, lockerId);
if (!locker) {
  failedLockers.push({ kioskId, lockerId, reason: 'not_found' });
  continue;
}

// Skip VIP lockers if excludeVip is true
if (locker.is_vip && excludeVip) {
  failedLockers.push({ kioskId, lockerId, reason: 'vip' });
  continue;
}
```

### 2. Individual Locker Open with VIP Protection

**Problem**: Individual locker opens didn't respect VIP status.

**Solution**:
- Added VIP check in individual locker open endpoint
- Require `override: true` to open VIP lockers
- Return 423 status code for VIP lockers without override
- Log VIP status in event details

### 3. RFID User Flow (`app/kiosk/src/services/rfid-user-flow.ts`)

**Problem**: RFID flow was calling `releaseLocker` for VIP lockers after successful open.

**Solution**:
- Check `locker.is_vip` after successful open in `handleCardWithLocker`
- For VIP lockers: emit success without calling `releaseLocker`
- For non-VIP lockers: continue with normal release flow
- Added new event `locker_opened_vip` for VIP-specific handling

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
if (locker.is_vip) {
  // For VIP lockers, emit success without releasing ownership
  this.emit('locker_opened_vip', {
    card_id: cardId,
    locker_id: lockerId,
    message: `VIP Dolap ${lockerId} açıldı`
  });
  return {
    success: true,
    action: 'open_locker',
    message: `VIP Dolap ${lockerId} açıldı`,
    opened_locker: lockerId
  };
}
```

### 4. Heartbeat Command Handlers (`app/kiosk/src/index.ts`)

**Problem**: Heartbeat commands were releasing VIP lockers and ignoring `exclude_vip` filter.

**Solution**:

#### `open_locker` Command:
- Fetch locker to check VIP status before processing
- Skip `releaseLocker` for VIP lockers unless `force: true`
- Return appropriate success message for VIP vs regular lockers

#### `bulk_open` Command:
- Fetch each locker to check VIP status
- Skip VIP lockers when `exclude_vip` is true, tracking them separately
- Avoid releasing VIP lockers even when opened
- Return detailed error messages for failed and skipped lockers

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Skip VIP lockers if exclude_vip is true
if (locker.is_vip && exclude_vip) {
  vipSkipped.push(lockerId);
  continue;
}

const success = await modbusController.openLocker(lockerId);
if (success) {
  // Skip release for VIP lockers
  if (!locker.is_vip) {
    await lockerStateManager.releaseLocker(KIOSK_ID, lockerId);
  }
  successCount++;
}
```

### 5. QR Handler (`app/kiosk/src/controllers/qr-handler.ts`)

**Problem**: QR endpoints were always active for VIP lockers and would release them.

**Solution**:

#### QR GET Request:
- Check `locker.is_vip` and return 423 status with appropriate error message
- Block QR interface access for VIP lockers entirely

#### QR Action Handling:
- Return 423 status for any VIP locker action attempts
- In `handleReleaseAction`: skip actual release for VIP lockers while still opening
- Return appropriate success message without releasing ownership

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Check if VIP locker - return 423 status as per requirements
if (locker.is_vip) {
  reply.code(423).type('text/html').send(
    this.generateErrorPage('VIP dolap. QR kapalı', 'tr', 'VIP locker. QR disabled')
  );
  return;
}
```

## Unit Tests Added

### 1. RFID User Flow VIP Tests (`app/kiosk/src/services/__tests__/rfid-user-flow-vip.test.ts`)
- Tests VIP locker opening without release
- Tests non-VIP locker normal operation
- Tests VIP locker opening failure handling
- Tests correct event emission for VIP lockers
- Tests VIP exclusion from available locker lists

### 2. Heartbeat Commands VIP Tests (`app/kiosk/src/__tests__/heartbeat-commands-vip.test.ts`)
- Tests individual locker commands with VIP handling
- Tests bulk commands with VIP exclusion
- Tests force parameter for VIP override
- Tests mixed success/failure scenarios

### 3. QR Handler VIP Tests (`app/kiosk/src/controllers/__tests__/qr-handler-vip.test.ts`)
- Tests 423 status returns for VIP locker access
- Tests VIP locker release without actual release
- Tests VIP locker assignment prevention
- Tests normal operation for non-VIP lockers

### 4. Panel Routes Logic Tests (`app/panel/src/__tests__/locker-routes-vip.test.ts`)
- Tests VIP identification in bulk operations
- Tests VIP override logic
- Tests VIP filtering in end-of-day operations
- Tests VIP exclusion in various scenarios

## Configuration Changes

### Default VIP Exclusion
- All bulk operations now default to `excludeVip: true`
- End-of-day operations exclude VIP lockers by default
- Staff can override with explicit `excludeVip: false` or `override: true`

### Status Codes
- VIP locker access attempts return HTTP 423 (Locked) status
- Consistent error messaging in Turkish and English
- Proper logging of VIP-related operations

## Behavioral Changes

### VIP Locker States
- VIP lockers remain in `Owned` state after opening (no automatic release)
- VIP lockers are excluded from available locker lists for assignment
- VIP lockers require explicit staff override for bulk operations

### User Experience
- RFID users with VIP lockers get success message without release
- QR users cannot access VIP lockers (423 error)
- Staff see clear VIP exclusion in bulk operation results

### Logging and Auditing
- All VIP-related operations are logged with `is_vip: true` flag
- Failed operations due to VIP status are recorded with reason `vip`
- Separate event types for VIP locker operations

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ RFID User Flow VIP Tests (5/5 passed)
- ✅ Heartbeat Commands VIP Tests (6/6 passed)  
- ✅ QR Handler VIP Tests (6/6 passed)
- ✅ Panel Routes Logic Tests (5/5 passed)

## Deployment Notes

### Database Requirements
- Ensure `is_vip` column exists in `lockers` table
- No migration required if column already exists

### Configuration Updates
- Review any existing bulk operation scripts to handle new `excludeVip` parameter
- Update staff training on VIP override procedures

### Monitoring
- Monitor for 423 status codes in QR access logs
- Track VIP exclusion counts in bulk operations
- Verify VIP lockers maintain ownership after opening

## Summary

The VIP locker handling fixes ensure:
1. **VIP lockers maintain ownership** after opening (no automatic release)
2. **Bulk operations respect VIP exclusion** with proper filtering
3. **QR access is blocked** for VIP lockers with appropriate error codes
4. **Staff override capabilities** are available when needed
5. **Comprehensive logging** tracks all VIP-related operations
6. **Thorough test coverage** validates all scenarios

These changes maintain system security while providing flexibility for staff operations and clear user feedback.
