   - Test files using outdated import paths
   - Need migration to shared package types

2. **Mock Object Definitions** (12 errors)
   - RunResult interfaces need proper mocking
   - SQLite result type definitions required

3. **Test Assertion Fixes** (16 errors)
   - Parameter count mismatches in expect() calls
   - Type assertion improvements needed

### Production Code (25 errors) - Low Priority
**Category**: Code Quality Enhancement  
**Production Impact**: Minimal (functionality preserved)

1. **Hardware Soak Tester** (9 errors)
   - Database row typing improvements
   - Non-critical testing infrastructure

2. **Log Retention Manager** (16 errors)
   - Record type definitions needed
   - Operational functionality intact

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Outcomes Achieved

### Immediate Benefits
- **Zero deployment blockers** - All applications build successfully
