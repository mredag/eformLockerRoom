# üçì Raspberry Pi eForm Locker System Setup Guide
*A Complete Guide for Kids and Beginners*

## üéØ What We're Building

Imagine a smart locker system like the ones at Amazon pickup locations! We're going to build our own using:
- A tiny computer (Raspberry Pi) as the "brain"
- Special locks that open with electricity
- Cards that you tap to unlock lockers
- A touchscreen to control everything

## üì¶ Hardware Shopping List

Here's what you need for the demo (like a recipe for building our system):

### Main Components
- **1√ó Raspberry Pi 5** + touchscreen (the brain of our system)
- **2√ó RS485 16-channel Modbus relay cards** (controls up to 32 locks!)
- **1√ó USB RS485 converter** + 1 spare (translates computer talk to lock talk)
- **1√ó K02 12V solenoid lock** (the actual lock mechanism)
- **1√ó 12V Power Supply 10-15A** (gives power to everything)
- **1√ó USB HID RFID reader** (reads the tap cards)

### Extra Supplies You'll Need
- MicroSD card (32GB or larger)
- Ethernet cable or WiFi setup
- USB cables
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (for testing)
- Multimeter (to check connections)

## üîß Step 1: Prepare Your Raspberry Pi

### Install the Operating System
1. **Download Raspberry Pi Imager** from the official website
2. **Flash Raspberry Pi OS** (64-bit) to your microSD card
3. **Enable SSH and WiFi** during the imaging process
4. **Insert the SD card** and boot up your Pi

### Update Your System
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install git nodejs npm python3-pip -y
```

### Install Node.js 20 (Required for our system)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## üîå Step 2: Hardware Connections

### Understanding the Components

**Think of it like building with LEGO blocks:**
- Raspberry Pi = The main control block
- RS485 cards = The "muscle" blocks that control locks
- RFID reader = The "eyes" that see your cards
- Power supply = The "energy" block that powers everything

console.log('Tap an RFID card now...');
"
```

## üöÄ Step 5: Start the System

### Start All Services
```bash
# Start the gateway (main controller)
npm run start:gateway &

# Start the kiosk interface

- Display usage statistics

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "No RS485 device found"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check USB devices
lsusb
# Look for your RS485 converter

# Check serial ports
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
# Should show /dev/ttyUSB0

# Check permissions
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Problem: "Relay not responding"
**Solution:**
1. Check power connections (12V to relay cards)
2. Verify RS485 wiring (A+ to A+, B- to B-)
3. Confirm relay card addresses are set correctly
4. Test with multimeter

### Problem: "RFID not working"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check input devices
ls /dev/input/event*

# Test RFID as keyboard
cat /dev/input/event0
# Tap card - should show data

# Check permissions
sudo chmod 644 /dev/input/event0
```

### Problem: "Lock doesn't open"
**Solution:**
1. Check 12V power supply output
2. Verify solenoid lock wiring
3. Test relay activation with multimeter
4. Check lock mechanism isn't jammed

## üìö Understanding the Modbus Protocol

### What is Modbus?
Think of Modbus like a language that computers use to talk to industrial equipment. It's like giving commands to robots!

### Basic Modbus Commands We Use
```javascript
// Turn on relay (unlock locker)
writeCoil(slaveAddress, coilAddress, true)

// Turn off relay (lock locker)  
writeCoil(slaveAddress, coilAddress, false)

// Check relay status
readCoils(slaveAddress, coilAddress, 1)
```

### Relay Card Settings (Waveshare 16CH)
- **Baud Rate:** 9600 (default), configurable via DIP switch 9
- **Data Bits:** 8
- **Stop Bits:** 1  
- **Parity:** None (default), configurable via DIP switch 10
- **Default Address:** 1 (change with DIP switches 1-8)
- **Function Codes:** 0x01 (Read), 0x05 (Write Single), 0x0F (Write Multiple)

### DIP Switch Configuration
**Card #1 (Address 1):** Set switches 1-8 to `00000001`
**Card #2 (Address 2):** Set switches 1-8 to `00000010`
**Baud Rate:** Switch 9 - OFF for 9600 baud
**Parity:** Switch 10 - OFF for no parity

## üéØ Fun Experiments to Try

### Experiment 1: Light Show
```javascript
// Make all relays blink in sequence
for(let i = 1; i <= 16; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        controller.activateRelay(1, i, 500);
    }, i * 100);
}
```

### Experiment 2: Card Memory Game
- Program different cards to open different lockers
- Create a memory game where kids match cards to lockers

### Experiment 3: Timed Challenges
- Set up automatic lock/unlock sequences
- Create escape room style puzzles

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Tips

### Electrical Safety
- Always turn off power before making connections
- Use a multimeter to verify voltages
- Keep water away from electronics
- Adult supervision required for 12V connections

### Software Safety
- Always backup your configuration
- Test changes on one locker first
- Keep the master PIN secure
- Monitor system logs for errors

## üìñ Next Steps

### Advanced Features to Explore
1. **Add more locks** (up to 32 with current setup)
2. **Integrate cameras** for security monitoring
3. **Add sound effects** for better user experience
4. **Create mobile app** for remote management
5. **Add sensors** to detect if items are placed in lockers

### Learning Opportunities
- Learn about industrial automation
- Understand database design
- Explore web development
- Study security systems
- Practice electronics and wiring

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've built a professional-grade locker system! This is the same technology used in:
- Amazon pickup lockers
- Gym and school lockers
- Package delivery systems
- Secure storage facilities

Keep experimenting and learning - you're now an IoT engineer! üöÄ
