## Emergency Opening Procedures

### 1. Power Outage Emergency Opening

**Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**
1. Verify UPS status and remaining battery time
2. Access emergency master key cabinet
3. Announce to facility users about temporary service interruption
4. Begin manual opening of critical lockers (medical items, valuables)

**Manual Opening Process:**
1. Use physical master key for mechanical override
2. Document each opened locker:
   - Locker ID and location
   - Time opened
   - Contents (if any)
   - User identification (if present)
3. Place "OUT OF ORDER" signs on opened lockers

**System Recovery Actions:**
1. Once power is restored, restart all services in order:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start eform-gateway
   sudo systemctl start eform-kiosk
   sudo systemctl start eform-panel
   sudo systemctl start eform-agent
   ```
2. Verify system health: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
3. Check for restart events in logs: `journalctl -u eform-gateway -n 50`
4. Update locker status in panel to reflect manual openings

### 2. System Failure Emergency Opening

**When Software/Hardware Fails:**
1. Access staff panel emergency interface
2. Use bulk opening function with reason "EMERGENCY"
3. If panel is inaccessible, use kiosk master PIN
4. If all electronic systems fail, use physical master keys

**Emergency Panel Access:**
- URL: `http://[panel-ip]:3003/emergency` (Updated port)
- Emergency admin credentials stored in secure cabinet
- Bypass normal authentication in emergency mode
- **Interface Language:** Turkish (TÃ¼rkÃ§e)

**Kiosk Master PIN Emergency:**
1. Press and hold Master button for 10 seconds
2. Enter emergency PIN: `*911*` (bypasses normal PIN)
3. Select "EMERGENCY OPEN ALL"
4. Confirm with facility manager authorization

### 3. Fire/Evacuation Emergency

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Activate emergency evacuation protocol
2. Use fire panel integration to open ALL lockers automatically
3. Announce: "All lockers are now open for evacuation"
4. Ensure all exit routes are clear

**Fire Panel Integration Commands:**
```bash
# Emergency open all (fire alarm triggered)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/emergency/fire-open-all \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [fire-system-token]"
```

### 4. Medical Emergency Access

**For Medical Emergencies:**
1. Use medical override PIN: `*MED*[locker-number]*`
2. Document medical access in emergency log
3. Notify facility management immediately
4. Preserve any medical items found
