## 🗂️ Detailed File Operations

### 1. Documentation Consolidation Actions

#### Root-Level Documentation Cleanup
**Files Removed from Root Directory:**
```
BEFORE (25+ files) → AFTER (3 files)
├── README.md (preserved - main project documentation)
├── CONTRIBUTING.md (preserved - development guidelines)  
├── LICENSE (preserved - legal requirement)
└── [22 other files] → Consolidated or moved to docs/
```

**Consolidation Mapping:**

| Source Files | Target Location | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| `deployment-guide.md`<br>`pi-setup-instructions.md`<br>`raspberry-pi-deployment.md`<br>`production-deployment.md`<br>`installation-guide.md` | `docs/DEPLOYMENT_README.md` | Multiple deployment guides covering same topics with overlapping information |
| `troubleshooting-*.md` (8 files)<br>`debug-procedures.md`<br>`common-issues.md` | `docs/troubleshooting/` directory | Scattered troubleshooting information needed centralized organization |
| `performance-guide.md`<br>`monitoring-setup.md`<br>`system-optimization.md` | `docs/performance-monitoring-guide.md` | Performance-related documentation consolidated for better navigation |
| `pi-configuration-*.md` (4 files)<br>`hardware-setup.md` | `docs/pi-configuration-guide.md` | Hardware setup instructions scattered across multiple files |
| `rollback-*.md` (3 files)<br>`recovery-procedures.md` | `docs/rollback-procedures.md` | Recovery procedures needed single authoritative source |

#### Specialized Documentation Organization
**New Directory Structure:**
```
docs/
├── integrations/           # Third-party integration guides
│   └── maksisoft-integration-guide.md
├── troubleshooting/        # Issue resolution procedures
│   ├── hardware-integration-guide.md
│   ├── archived-incidents-summary.md
│   └── README.md
├── maintenance/           # System maintenance procedures
│   └── system-fixes-reference.md
└── [7 essential root-level docs]
```

### 2. Script Organization and Cleanup

#### Script Categorization Results
**Analysis Summary:**
- **Total Scripts Analyzed**: 100+ scripts
- **Essential Scripts Preserved**: 60 scripts
- **Obsolete Scripts Removed**: 31 scripts
- **Duplicate Scripts Consolidated**: 9 scripts merged into 3

**Organization by Purpose:**
```
scripts/
├── deployment/     # 15 scripts - Production deployment automation
├── testing/        # 12 scripts - Hardware and integration testing
├── maintenance/    # 18 scripts - System maintenance utilities
├── emergency/      # 8 scripts - Emergency response procedures
└── setup/         # 7 scripts - Initial configuration
```

#### Removed Scripts with Justification

| Script Name | Category | Removal Reason | Dependencies Checked |
|------------|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| `deploy-temp-fix.sh` | Temporary | Created for specific resolved issue | ✅ None found |
| `debug-relay-issue-20250815.js` | Debug | Timestamped debug script for resolved issue | ✅ None found |
| `test-maksisoft-buttons-old.html` | Test | Superseded by newer test implementation | ✅ None found |
| `backup-before-cleanup.sh` | Backup | One-time backup script, no longer needed | ✅ None found |
| `migration-status-check.js` | Migration | Legacy migration script for completed migration | ✅ None found |

#### Consolidated Scripts

| Original Scripts | Consolidated Into | Reasoning |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| `deploy-gateway.sh`<br>`deploy-kiosk.sh`<br>`deploy-panel.sh` | `scripts/deployment/deploy-all-services.sh` | Duplicate deployment logic, single script more maintainable |
| `test-relay-1.js`<br>`test-relay-2.js`<br>`test-relay-basic.js` | `scripts/testing/test-basic-relay-control.js` | Similar relay testing functionality consolidated |
| `backup-db.sh`<br>`backup-logs.sh`<br>`backup-config.sh` | `scripts/maintenance/comprehensive-backup.sh` | Backup operations unified for consistency |

### 3. Test File Organization

#### Test Structure Standardization
**Before Cleanup:**
```
├── test-*.html (15 ad-hoc test files)
├── debug-*.js (12 debugging scripts)
├── temp-test-*.ts (8 temporary test files)
└── Various scattered test directories
```

**After Organization:**
```
tests/
├── integration/           # Cross-service integration tests
│   ├── accessibility-requirements.test.ts
│   ├── admin-panel-ui-improvements.test.ts
│   ├── backend-integration.test.ts
│   ├── real-time-state-sync.test.ts
│   ├── session-management-lifecycle.test.ts
│   ├── turkish-language-validation.test.ts
│   └── websocket-realtime-ui-updates.test.ts
└── README.md             # Testing documentation

app/*/src/__tests__/      # Service-specific unit tests
shared/**/__tests__/      # Shared utility tests
```

#### Removed Test Artifacts

| File Pattern | Count | Reasoning | Safety Check |
|-------------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| `test-maksisoft-*.html` | 6 | Ad-hoc HTML test files for resolved issues | ✅ No active references |
| `debug-*-timestamp.js` | 9 | Timestamped debugging scripts | ✅ No dependencies found |
| `temp-test-*.ts` | 8 | Temporary test files for specific debugging | ✅ Functionality moved to proper tests |

### 4. Legacy File Cleanup

#### Legacy Artifacts Removed

| Category | Files Removed | Reasoning | Backup Status |
|----------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Deployment Status | 12 files | Temporary status files from specific deployments | ✅ Content archived |
| Migration Summaries | 8 files | Completion summaries for finished migrations | ✅ Historical value preserved |
| Incident Reports | 6 files | Specific incident reports moved to proper location | ✅ Moved to `docs/troubleshooting/` |
| Debug Artifacts | 15 files | Debugging files for resolved issues | ✅ No longer needed |

#### Content Preservation Actions

| Original File | Preservation Action | New Location |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| `incident-report-kiosk-failure-aug2025.md` | Moved | `docs/troubleshooting/archived-incidents-summary.md` |
| `migration-006-completion-summary.md` | Content merged | `migrations/006_pin_rotation_system.sql` (comments) |
| `performance-optimization-results.md` | Consolidated | `docs/performance-monitoring-guide.md` |
