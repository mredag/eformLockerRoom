# Accessibility Approach for Small Gym Kiosk

## Decision: Basic Accessibility Only

**Task 23: REMOVED - WCAG AA accessibility compliance**

For this small gym locker system (2-3 kiosks, 1-2 staff members), we have decided to implement **basic accessibility features only** rather than full WCAG AA compliance.

## Rationale

- **Target Audience**: Small gym members using simple kiosk interface
- **Usage Context**: Physical kiosk with touch screen in controlled environment
- **Scale**: 2-3 kiosks, not enterprise-level deployment
- **Complexity**: Full WCAG AA compliance would be overkill for this use case

## Basic Accessibility Features Implemented

### ✅ Essential Features (Kept)

1. **Help Button on Lock Failure**
   - Help button appears when locker fails to open
   - Pre-fills help form with lock problem category
   - Requirement 7.1 ✅

2. **Text Size Toggle**
   - Simple normal/large text size toggle
   - Preference saved in localStorage
   - Visual indicator when large text mode active
   - Requirement 7.2 ✅

3. **Back Button Navigation**
   - Back buttons on all screens with navigation
   - Consistent styling and positioning
   - Keyboard accessible (Tab + Enter)
   - Requirement 7.3 ✅

4. **Basic Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab navigation through interactive elements
   - Arrow key navigation for grids and keypads
   - Escape key returns to main screen
   - Enter key activates focused elements
   - Requirement 7.6 ✅

5. **Focus Management**
   - Focus stays within current screen
   - Enhanced focus indicators for visibility
   - Basic focus management without over-engineering

6. **Skip Link**
   - Simple skip to main content link for screen readers
   - Basic screen reader support without complex ARIA

### ❌ Complex Features (Removed/Not Implemented)

1. **Full WCAG AA Compliance**
   - Complex ARIA attributes and roles
   - Advanced screen reader support
   - Detailed accessibility testing
   - Complex keyboard shortcuts

2. **Advanced Screen Reader Support**

   - Live regions for dynamic content
   - Advanced semantic markup

3. **Enterprise Accessibility Features**
   - High contrast mode
   - Advanced keyboard shortcuts
   - Complex focus management
   - Accessibility audit compliance

## Current Implementation Status

The current kiosk implementation includes appropriate basic accessibility features:

- ✅ Text size toggle with large text mode CSS
- ✅ Keyboard navigation with arrow keys and tab
- ✅ Focus management within screens
- ✅ Skip link for screen readers
- ✅ Help button on lock failure screen
- ✅ Back buttons on all navigation screens
- ✅ Basic focus indicators

## Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 7.1**: Help button on lock failure ✅
- **Requirement 7.2**: Text size toggle (normal/large) ✅  
- **Requirement 7.3**: Back buttons on navigation screens ✅
- **Requirement 7.6**: Basic keyboard navigation ✅
- **Requirement 7.7**: Interface readable and functional for gym users ✅

## Conclusion

The current basic accessibility implementation is **sufficient and appropriate** for a small gym kiosk system. Full WCAG AA compliance would add unnecessary complexity without meaningful benefit for the target use case.

The system provides essential accessibility features while maintaining simplicity and reliability for small business operations.
