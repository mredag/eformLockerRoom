   - Need proper mock interfaces for SQLite results

3. **Test Assertion Issues** (12 errors)
   - expect() calls with incorrect parameter counts
   - Type assertion issues in test expectations

4. **Unknown Type Issues** (25 errors)
   - Database row objects typed as 'unknown'
   - JSON.parse results need proper typing

5. **Test Data Issues** (8 errors)
   - Missing required properties in test objects
   - Null/undefined parameter issues

### Production Code Issues (25 errors)
