# Automatic Locker Timeout Removal - Complete

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**

**Problem**: Lockers were automatically resetting from `Owned` to `Free` after 90 seconds due to an automatic cleanup mechanism.

**Root Cause**: The `LockerStateManager` had an automatic cleanup timer that ran every 30 seconds and released any locker in `Owned` status for more than 90 seconds.

## 🛠️ **Changes Made**

### **1. Disabled Automatic Cleanup Timer**
- **File**: `shared/services/locker-state-manager.ts`
- **Change**: Removed `setInterval` that ran cleanup every 30 seconds
- **Method**: `startCleanupTimer()` now logs that cleanup is disabled

### **2. Disabled Cleanup Method**
- **File**: `shared/services/locker-state-manager.ts`
- **Method**: `cleanupExpiredReservations()` now returns 0 and logs that it's disabled
- **Impact**: No automatic state transitions from `Owned` to `Free`

### **3. Removed Timeout State Transitions**
- **File**: `shared/services/locker-state-manager.ts`
- **Removed**: `{ from: 'Owned', to: 'Free', trigger: 'timeout', conditions: ['expired_90_seconds'] }`
- **Impact**: No valid automatic timeout transitions in state machine

### **4. Removed Configuration Variables**
- **Files**: `config/system.json`, `app/panel/config/system.json`
- **Removed**: `reserve_ttl_seconds` configuration option
- **Removed**: `RESERVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `cleanupInterval` variables

### **5. Updated Documentation**
- **Files**: `.kiro/steering/project-development-guide.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- **Changed**: References to "5-minute timeout" → "no automatic timeout"
- **Updated**: Feature descriptions to reflect manual-only release

## 🧪 **Testing**

Created `test-no-timeout.js` to verify:
- Locker can be assigned successfully
- Locker remains `Owned` for extended periods (2+ minutes)
- No automatic state changes occur
- Manual release still works

## 📋 **Current Behavior**

### **Before (Problematic)**
```
1. Card scanned → Locker assigned (Owned)
2. Wait 90+ seconds → Automatic cleanup runs
3. Locker automatically released (Free)
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```
1. Card scanned → Locker assigned (Owned)
2. Wait indefinitely → No automatic changes
3. Manual release required → Locker released (Free)
```

## 🔒 **Locker Release Methods**

Lockers can now only be released through:

1. **Same card scan**: User scans same RFID card to release
2. **Staff action**: Admin panel manual release
3. **API call**: Direct API call to release endpoint

## ⚡ **Power Interruption Resilience**

The system is designed to survive power outages and system restarts:

### **Database Persistence**
- All locker assignments stored in SQLite database with WAL mode
- Database survives power interruptions and system crashes
- Locker states automatically restored on system startup

### **Recovery Process**
- `scripts/power-interruption-recovery.js` runs on startup
- Validates database integrity and reports recovered assignments
- Identifies any inconsistent states requiring manual intervention
- Logs recovery events for audit trail

### **What Survives Power Outages**
✅ **Preserved**:
- Locker assignments (`Owned` status)
- Owner information (RFID card IDs)
- Assignment timestamps
- VIP locker configurations
- Blocked locker states

❌ **Cleared**:
- Pending command queues
- Active RFID sessions (UI level)
- Temporary WebSocket connections

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **No automatic cleanup**: Lockers will remain assigned indefinitely
- **Manual management**: Staff must monitor and release stuck lockers
- **Database persistence**: Locker states survive service restarts and power outages
- **Session timeout**: RFID UI sessions still timeout (30 seconds), but locker assignments persist

## 🚀 **Deployment**

To deploy these changes:

```bash
# On development machine
git add .
git commit -m "fix(lockers): remove automatic timeout - manual release only"
git push origin main

# On Raspberry Pi
ssh pi@pi-eform-locker
cd /home/pi/eform-locker
git pull origin main
npm run build:all
./scripts/start-all-clean.sh
```

## ✅ **Verification**

After deployment, verify:
1. No "Cleaned up X expired reservations" messages in logs
2. Assigned lockers remain `Owned` indefinitely
3. Manual release via same card still works
4. Admin panel release functionality works

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Automatic locker timeout fully removed
**Date**: September 2, 2025
**Impact**: Lockers now require manual release only
