CHATGPT ANSWERS
=====
The authentication failure is not caused by the password itself. On your Pi the bundled build uses SQLite prepared statements, and those statements return empty objects instead of real rows. The missing row data means password_hash is either empty or undefined, so bcrypt.compare has nothing valid to compare. This issue is documented in your own fix summary: esbuild does not handle SQLite3’s native module correctly, so prepared statements return {} instead of the expected data
GitHub
. Because the password hash read from the database is invalid, your log shows “Invalid password hash for user: emre” and the comparison fails.

Root cause

Bundling & prepared statements – Your esbuild bundle strips out the native SQLite3 code, so db.prepare(...).get(...) returns an empty object. The password_hash field is therefore null or blank, causing bcrypt.compare to return false
GitHub
.

Limited logging – The original AuthService logged “Invalid password hash” but did not show why the hash was missing. This masked the real problem.

Environment mismatch – Development on Windows worked because the code was not bundled. The issue only appears in the ARM64 production build on the Pi, where the bundle uses prepared statements.

Debugging steps

Check the stored hash – Use the SQLite CLI or debug-admin-user.js to inspect the password_hash field in the database. The debug script prints hash length and can regenerate invalid hashes
GitHub
.

Run validation scripts – Execute node scripts/validate-complete-fix.js on the Pi. The script creates a test user, verifies the password using bcrypt.compare, and confirms that password verification succeeds
GitHub
. If this script fails, the environment or build is broken.

Verify bcrypt manually – Start a Node REPL on the Pi. Require bcrypt, read the hash from the database, and call bcrypt.compare('knownPassword', hash). This isolates whether bcrypt works outside the bundled code.

Rebuild dependencies – Reinstall bcrypt from source on the Pi (npm rebuild bcrypt --build-from-source) to ensure the native module matches your ARM64 node version.

Check Node and package versions – Make sure you use a stable node version and a compatible bcrypt version (the bcrypt README warns about version compatibility
npmjs.com
).

Code fixes

Avoid prepared statements in bundled code – Modify AuthService to use direct SQLite methods (db.get and db.run). The fix summary notes that this bypasses esbuild’s transformation problems
GitHub
.

Validate the hash before comparing – In the rewritten service, check that password_hash is a non-empty string before verifying
GitHub
. If it is empty, log an error and refuse the login.

Switch to Argon2 – The updated AuthService in your repository hashes passwords with Argon2 when creating users
GitHub
 and verifies them with argon2.verify during login
GitHub
. Argon2 is a modern, memory‑hard algorithm and avoids the native-module issues that plagued bcrypt.

Trim whitespace – When reading from SQLite, trim the stored hash. Any extra whitespace will invalidate the hash.

Alternative approaches

Use Argon2 or scrypt – You already added the argon2 package. It is purely JavaScript and uses WebAssembly under the hood, so it works consistently across architectures. Node’s built‑in crypto.scrypt is another option. Both are recommended over bcrypt for new projects.

Centralize authentication – Move authentication logic into a shared module used by both the web interface and any scripts. This eliminates differences between development and production environments.

Use JWT and session tokens – Once a user is authenticated, issue a signed token (e.g., JWT) rather than checking the password on each request. This reduces database load and simplifies the login flow.

Testing strategy

Unit tests for hashing – Write tests that call createUser and then immediately call validateUser with the same password. Ensure the hash is persisted and that verification succeeds. Use a variety of passwords, including long ones, to detect truncation.

Cross‑environment tests – Run the same unit tests on your development machine and on the Raspberry Pi to catch platform‑specific issues.

Integration tests for user flows – Using a test database, simulate the full login process through the API. Verify that the correct status codes and error messages are returned.

Validation scripts – Keep using validate-complete-fix.js to confirm database operations and password checks
GitHub
. Extend it to test other roles or tables, such as staff_users.

By addressing the bundling issue and adopting Argon2, you avoid the problems with bcrypt native modules on ARM. The updated code uses direct SQLite operations and thorough error checking, so the panel login should work consistently

=====

Root Cause
The AuthService both hashes and verifies passwords with argon2 (argon2.hash on user creation and argon2.verify on login). Stored hashes in your database begin with $2b$…, which indicates bcrypt. Because argon2 cannot verify a bcrypt hash, login attempts always fail

Suggested task
Ensure consistent password hashing
1. Remove any bcrypt-based user records or rehash them using argon2.
2. Confirm all user-creation paths (including scripts) call `argon2.hash`.
3. If historical bcrypt hashes must remain, store the algorithm type with each user and branch logic in `authenticateUser` accordingly.
Debugging Steps
Inspect the password_hash column for existing users; bcrypt hashes start with $2a$/ $2b$/.

Recreate an account with the current scripts/create-admin-directly.js (which already uses argon2) and verify login.

Temporarily log the hash prefix and the result of argon2.verify to confirm the algorithm mismatch.

Code Fixes
Unify hashing across the application—either migrate all stored hashes to argon2 or switch AuthService back to bcrypt.

Consider including an “algorithm” field in the users table to allow gradual migration and proper validation.

Alternative Approaches
Standardize on a single algorithm (argon2 preferred for memory-hard resistance).

Use libraries like @node-rs/argon2 or bcryptjs if native bindings pose deployment issues, or move authentication to a managed service for simplicity.

Testing Strategy
Add unit tests that create a user and authenticate with the same algorithm to ensure round‑trip success.

Include regression tests that attempt to authenticate with unsupported hash formats, verifying that meaningful errors are returned.

Run integration tests on the Raspberry Pi build to confirm bundle settings do not alter the hashing behavior.

Suggested task
Add authentication tests
1. In `app/panel/src/__tests__/auth-service.test.ts`, create a user via `createUser` and verify login succeeds.
2. Add a test inserting a bcrypt-hashed user and confirm `authenticateUser` rejects it with a clear error.
3. Ensure tests run during CI on Raspberry Pi or an emulator to mirror production.
