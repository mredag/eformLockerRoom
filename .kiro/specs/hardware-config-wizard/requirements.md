# Hardware Configuration Wizard - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Hardware Configuration Wizard is a comprehensive, guided setup system that transforms the current basic hardware configuration page into an intelligent, automated wizard for configuring Modbus relay cards. This feature addresses the critical need for "Zero-Knowledge Setup" - enabling anyone to add and configure Modbus relay cards without technical expertise through step-by-step guidance, real-time validation, and intelligent automation.

The current system requires manual configuration, lacks validation, and provides no guidance for users setting up new hardware. This wizard will provide automated hardware detection, guided slave address configuration, real-time testing, and seamless system integration.

## Requirements

2. WHEN configuring slave address THEN the system SHALL use broadcast commands (address 0x00) to set the new address
3. WHEN address configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify the new address by reading register 0x4000
4. IF address conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically resolve conflicts by finding alternative addresses
5. WHEN multiple cards need configuration THEN the system SHALL handle sequential addressing automatically
6. IF address configuration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and retry options

### Requirement 4: Real-Time Hardware Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a technician, I want the system to automatically test new hardware during setup, so that I can verify everything is working correctly before completing the installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardware testing begins THEN the system SHALL test basic Modbus communication with the new card
2. WHEN testing relay functionality THEN the system SHALL activate test relays (1, 8, 16) and confirm physical clicks
3. WHEN testing is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time test results with pass/fail indicators
4. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation with green checkmarks
5. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific failure details and troubleshooting steps
6. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL allow retesting or proceeding to integration

### Requirement 5: System Integration and Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want new hardware to be automatically integrated into the system configuration, so that it becomes immediately available for use without manual configuration file editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardware integration begins THEN the system SHALL update the system.json configuration file with new card details
2. WHEN updating configuration THEN the system SHALL calculate new total locker count and adjust layout accordingly
3. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL restart necessary hardware services automatically
4. WHEN integration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that new lockers are accessible via API
5. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback configuration changes and provide error details
6. WHEN integration succeeds THEN the system SHALL display updated system status with new locker ranges

### Requirement 6: Dashboard and System Overview

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard showing hardware status and configuration options, so that I can quickly understand the current system state and available actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the hardware configuration page THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with system status overview
2. WHEN displaying system status THEN the system SHALL show total cards, total lockers, and overall health status
3. WHEN on the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide quick action buttons for scanning, adding cards, and testing
4. WHEN hardware changes occur THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard in real-time
5. IF system issues are detected THEN the system SHALL display warning indicators and diagnostic information
6. WHEN viewing card details THEN the system SHALL show individual card status, address, and locker ranges
