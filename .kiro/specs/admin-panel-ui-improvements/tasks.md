# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update CSS styling for locker status indicators

  - Add new CSS class `.state-sahipli` with red background color (#dc3545) for owned lockers
  - Update existing CSS classes to ensure proper color coding: `.state-bos` (green), `.state-aciliyor` (blue), `.state-engelli` (gray), `.state-hata` (gray)
  - Ensure text contrast ratios meet accessibility standards (minimum 4.5:1) for all status colors
  - Test color indicators across different locker states and screen types
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7_

- [x] 2. Fix Turkish status text translations in JavaScript

  - Update status translation mapping in `lockers.html` to correctly map "Owned" database status to "Sahipli" display text
  - Ensure all database statuses have correct Turkish translations: Free
    →Boş, Owned→Sahipli, Reserved→Rezerve, Opening→Açılıyor, Blocked→Engelli, Error→Hata
  - Add fallback handling for unknown status values to prevent UI errors
  - Test status text display across all possible locker states
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 3. Enhance RFID card number display functionality

  - Modify locker card HTML template to display full `owner_key` value instead of generic "rfid" text
  - Implement owner type detection to format display appropriately: RFID numbers shown directly, device IDs truncated with "Cihaz:" prefix

  - Add click-to-select functionality for RFID numbers to enable easy copying by staff
  - Handle empty or null owner values by displaying "Yok" (None) instead of empty text
  - Add truncation with ellipsis and hover tooltip for very long owner keys
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 4. Update locker card rendering logic

  - Modify the `renderLockerCard` function to use enhanced owner informati
    on from API response
  - Ensure proper status class application based on database status values
  - Add data attributes to locker cards for easier testing and debugging
  - Implement proper error handling for missing or malformed locker data
  - Test locker card rendering with various owner types and status combinations
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Verify real-time WebSocket updates work with new UI elements

  - Test that WebSocket state updates properly refresh RFID display information
  - Ensure status color changes are applied immediately when locker states change
  - Verify that owner information updates in real-time when lockers are assigned or released
  - Add smooth transition animations for status color changes
  - Test performance with multiple simultaneous locker state updates
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Add comprehensive testing for UI improvements

  - Write unit tests for status translation functions to ensure correct Turkish mappings
  - Add integration tests to verify API response handling with enhanced owner information

  - Add integration tests to verify API response handling with enhanced owner information
  - Implement visual regression tests for color scheme and layout consistency
  - Test click-to-select functionality across different browsers and devices
  - _Requirements: All requirements need testing coverage_

- [x] 7. Validate accessibility and usability improvements

- [ ] 7. Validate accessibility and usability improvements


  - Verify keyboard navigation works properly with enhanced RFID display elements
  - Test screen reader compatibility with new status text and owner information
  - Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards for all status indicators
  - Validate that information is accessible to users with color blindness
  - Test touch interface compatibility for click-to-select functionality on mobile devices
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_
