# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The eForm Locker System repository has accumulated numerous markdown files, scripts, and artifacts over development iterations. Many of these files are outdated, redundant, or no longer serve a purpose in the current production system. This cleanup initiative aims to organize, consolidate, and remove unnecessary files while preserving essential documentation and operational scripts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Documentation Cleanup and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized documentation structure, so that I can quickly find relevant information without being overwhelmed by outdated files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing root-level markdown files THEN the system SHALL identify and categorize files as active, outdated, or redundant
2. WHEN consolidating documentation THEN the system SHALL merge related content into comprehensive guides
3. WHEN organizing documentation THEN the system SHALL maintain a clear hierarchy in the docs/ folder
4. IF a markdown file contains outdated information THEN the system SHALL either update it or mark it for removal
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have no more than 10 essential documentation files in the root directory

### Requirement 2: Script Inventory and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want only essential and working scripts in the repository, so that I can confidently use automation tools without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing scripts THEN the system SHALL categorize each script as essential, redundant, or obsolete
2. WHEN a script is redundant THEN the system SHALL consolidate functionality into a single authoritative script
3. WHEN a script is obsolete THEN the system SHALL remove it after confirming no dependencies exist
4. IF a script has unclear purpose THEN the system SHALL add proper documentation or remove it
5. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL have no more than 30 essential scripts in the scripts/ folder

### Requirement 3: Test File Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files organized by purpose and relevance, so that I can maintain and run appropriate tests for the current system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing test files THEN the system SHALL identify active tests vs debugging artifacts
2. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL group related test files in appropriate directories
3. WHEN a test file is a temporary debugging artifact THEN the system SHALL remove it
4. IF a test file serves ongoing validation THEN the system SHALL preserve it in the proper location
5. WHEN organization is complete THEN the system SHALL have clear separation between unit tests, integration tests, and debugging tools

### Requirement 4: Legacy File Removal

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want legacy and temporary files removed, so that the repository reflects only the current system state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying legacy files THEN the system SHALL check for references in active code
2. WHEN a file has no active references THEN the system SHALL mark it for safe removal
3. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL create a backup list of removed items
4. IF a file might have historical value THEN the system SHALL document its purpose before removal
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have removed at least 50% of identified legacy files

### Requirement 5: Repository Structure Standardization

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want a standardized repository structure, so that I can quickly understand the project organization and locate relevant files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN standardizing structure THEN the system SHALL follow established Node.js project conventions
2. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL group similar files in appropriate directories
3. WHEN creating directory structure THEN the system SHALL use clear, descriptive names
4. IF files don't fit standard categories THEN the system SHALL create appropriate custom directories
5. WHEN standardization is complete THEN the system SHALL have a clear README explaining the structure

### Requirement 6: Cleanup Documentation and Tracking

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive documentation of cleanup actions, so that I can understand what was changed and potentially restore files if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing cleanup actions THEN the system SHALL log all file operations
2. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL document the reason for removal
3. WHEN consolidating content THEN the system SHALL track source files and merged content
4. IF files are moved THEN the system SHALL maintain a mapping of old to new locations
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive cleanup report
