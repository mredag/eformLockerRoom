# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Raspberry Pi Auto-Setup System is an intelligent automation tool that enables Kiro IDE to remotely connect to Raspberry Pi devices and automatically execute complete system setup procedures. The system follows existing setup guides, handles errors intelligently, and provides real-time feedback during the setup process. This eliminates the need for manual SSH sessions and reduces setup time from hours to minutes while ensuring consistent, error-free deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically connect to a Raspberry Pi and set up the complete eForm locker system, so that I can deploy systems quickly without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide SSH connection details (like `ssh pi@pi-eform-locker`) THEN the system SHALL establish a secure SSH connection to the Raspberry Pi
2. WHEN the SSH connection is established THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the current state of the Raspberry Pi (OS version, installed packages, hardware connections)
3. WHEN the system detects the Pi state THEN the system SHALL create an execution plan based on the existing setup guide
4. WHEN executing setup steps THEN the system SHALL follow the documented procedures from `docs/raspberry-pi-setup-guide.md`
5. WHEN a setup step completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log the success and proceed to the next step
6. WHEN a setup step fails THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic error resolution using predefined troubleshooting procedures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to intelligently handle errors during setup, so that I don't need to manually troubleshoot common issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command fails during setup THEN the system SHALL analyze the error output and determine the appropriate fix
2. WHEN an error matches a known troubleshooting pattern THEN the system SHALL automatically apply the documented solution
3. WHEN automatic error resolution succeeds THEN the system SHALL retry the original failed step
4. WHEN automatic error resolution fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested manual steps
5. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle each error systematically before proceeding
6. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL safely abort the setup and provide rollback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time visibility into the setup process, so that I can monitor progress and understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup process starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing current step and overall completion
2. WHEN executing each setup step THEN the system SHALL show the command being executed and its output in real-time
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display the error details and the attempted resolution steps
4. WHEN the setup completes THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive summary of all actions taken
5. WHEN the setup is in progress THEN the system SHALL allow the user to view detailed logs and system status
6. WHEN the user requests it THEN the system SHALL provide the ability to pause or cancel the setup process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that the setup was successful, so that I can be confident the system is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup process completes THEN the system SHALL automatically run all validation scripts from the setup guide
2. WHEN running validation tests THEN the system SHALL execute hardware validation, software validation, and integration tests
3. WHEN validation tests pass THEN the system SHALL report successful deployment with test results
4. WHEN validation tests fail THEN the system SHALL identify the specific issues and attempt to fix them
5. WHEN all validations pass THEN the system SHALL provide access URLs and next steps for using the deployed system
6. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL generate a deployment report with all setup steps, errors encountered, and final system status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage multiple Raspberry Pi devices, so that I can deploy and maintain multiple locker systems efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have multiple Pi devices THEN the system SHALL allow me to save and manage connection profiles for each device
2. WHEN managing multiple devices THEN the system SHALL show the status and last setup date for each device
3. WHEN deploying to multiple devices THEN the system SHALL support batch operations across selected devices
4. WHEN a device setup fails THEN the system SHALL continue with other devices and report individual results
5. WHEN devices have different configurations THEN the system SHALL support device-specific setup parameters
6. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide comparison views showing differences between device configurations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update existing Raspberry Pi installations, so that I can maintain systems with the latest software and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to an existing installation THEN the system SHALL detect the current version and configuration
2. WHEN an update is available THEN the system SHALL show what changes will be made before proceeding
3. WHEN performing updates THEN the system SHALL create backups before making any changes
4. WHEN updates fail THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities to restore the previous state
5. WHEN updates complete THEN the system SHALL run validation tests to ensure the system still works correctly
6. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL support selective updates of specific components or configurations
